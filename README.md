# Compile yourself
if you have any interest in compiling this game yourself there is a makefile and a makefile.varibales.example fiile in build/ take a look there,
all you need to do is copy pasta the makefile variables in a makfile.variable file and change the variables if needed and run make cbr.

i used linux for compiling so you might need to change some commands here and there if your using windows or macOs.

there is a documentation branch with minimal documentation
